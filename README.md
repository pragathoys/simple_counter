# Simple Counter

A simple counter app implemented as a Smart Contract.

## Scope of this project

With this project I would like to show you how to create a smart contract as simple as it can be and learn about :

- its structure
- how to declare and save data within a state variable
- how to create tests to help you maintain the code
- how to use the Remix development environment

## Usage

There is no actual usage of this project. The functionality is limited: you can simply increase the value of a state variable or reset it down to zero.

## Remix Development environment

Remix is and easy to use development environment directly available within your web browser.

Point your browser to the browser-based IDE: https://remix.ethereum.org/
